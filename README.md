# flutter_smart_home

A lightweight and completely local 'smart' home hub (stretching the word smart there).
This allows the user to enter names and URLs for smart switches so that they can be toggled from the app.
This is for use with tasmota. The motivations behind this are wanting to have wifi switches but becoming fed up with the apps and firmware available from suppliers.
Tasmota is a great firmware for control and keeping the control within the LAN but navigating to a website is clunky. This keeps the buttons in the same place and polls for the current status.
